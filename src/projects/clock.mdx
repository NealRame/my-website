# Clock

Nothing but a clock.

<ClockApp/>

I'm just using it as a proof of concept for the workflow I'll be using here for
my future projects portfolio.

## The workflow

```basic
10 Get an idea
20 Create a repo on Github
30 Code
40 Publish a package on NPM
50 Use the package in a project here
60 GOTO 10
```
