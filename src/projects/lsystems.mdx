# L-Systems

Lindenmayer systems or L-systems for short is a string-rewitting system
introduced by _[Aristid Lindenmayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristid_Lindenmayer)_
in 1968.

L-Systems were initially used to model the growth of plants, but they can be
also be used to generate fractals patterns.

I made a simple library based on [React](https://reactjs.org) to play with
<nobr>L-systems</nobr>. You can find it on [Github](https://github.com/NealRame/react-l-system).

## Hilbert Curve
<LSystem { ...HilbertCurve } stepsMin="1"/>

## Koch Curve
<LSystem { ...KockCurve } stepsMin="1" stepsInit="3" stepsMax="5"/>

## Koch Snowflake
<LSystem { ...KockSnowflake } stepsMax="5"/>

## Sierpinski Triangle
<LSystem { ... SierpinskiTriangle }/>
